# CSS Ribbon Toolbar
Simple Ribbon Toolbar Sketch

This is a very brief start to a potential editor or word processor toolbar, which may be expanded as needed. There is no JavaScript or third-party icons included anywhere. The CSS has an extra provision to render all icons in the toolbar as plain unicode symbols instead of emoji. Uncomment that section to render unicode symbols instead.
